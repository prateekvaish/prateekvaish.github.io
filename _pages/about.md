I am a PhD Candidate in Theoretical Chemistry at **Brown University**, advised by [Prof. Brenda Rubenstein](https://www.brown.edu/academics/chemistry/people/brenda-rubenstein). My research targets the most critical bottleneck in modern computational chemistry: **scalability**.

[cite_start]I develop novel quantum algorithms and machine learning techniques to simulate complex biological systems—from water networks to ATP hydrolysis [cite: 20]—on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum hardware.

### Why It Matters
The pharmaceutical industry is racing to utilize quantum advantages for drug discovery, but current hardware capabilities are limited. [cite_start]My work focuses on **Resource Estimation** and **Active Space Methods** [cite: 11] to drastically reduce the computational cost of these simulations.

### Key Contributions
* [cite_start]**Algorithm Development:** Spearheaded the development of **Active Space Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC)** theory, optimizing Hamiltonian reduction to make chemical simulations feasible on quantum devices[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]**Hardware-Aware Benchmarking:** Collaborated with scientists from **NASA** and **UIUC** to estimate the precise fault-tolerant resource requirements for simulating biological systems[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Machine Learning Integration:** Applied Transfer Learning and Neural Networks to accelerate Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Potential Energy Surface (PES) generation[cite: 20, 28].

[cite_start]Prior to my PhD, I completed my BS-MS at **IISER Kolkata** (CGPA 9.13/10) [cite: 8, 9] [cite_start]and held research positions at **Queen's University, Canada** [cite: 29] [cite_start]and **NISER Bhubaneswar**[cite: 34].

[cite_start]I am currently seeking R&D roles in **Quantum Applications** or **Computational Drug Discovery** where I can leverage my expertise in Python, Qiskit, and electronic structure theory[cite: 11, 13].
