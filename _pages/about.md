I am a PhD Candidate in Theoretical Chemistry at **Brown University**, advised by **Prof. [cite_start]Brenda Rubenstein**[cite: 5, 16]. [cite_start]My research focuses on the intersection of quantum chemistry and quantum computing, specifically developing algorithms to simulate molecular systems on quantum hardware[cite: 17].

[cite_start]Currently, I am working on **Active Space Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC)** theory [cite: 17] [cite_start]and collaborating with teams from NASA and UIUC on resource estimation for simulating biology on fault-tolerant hardware[cite: 18].

[cite_start]Prior to Brown, I completed my BS-MS Dual Degree in Chemical Sciences at **IISER Kolkata**, where I worked on quantum wave packet dynamics and potential energy surfaces[cite: 8, 27].

### Research Interests
* **Quantum Algorithms:** VQE, UCC, Active Space Methods [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]**Machine Learning:** Gaussian Process Regression, Neural Networks for PES [cite: 14]
* [cite_start]**Computational Chemistry:** Molecular Dynamics, PySCF, ORCA [cite: 12]
